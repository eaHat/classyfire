Description: The classyfire package provides optimised multivariate classification analysis by incorporating parallel programming as a means of significantly minimising the computational complexity and execution times as well as improving the overall performance of the classifiers and the classification ensembles. In addition, the package introduces a new heuristic methodology for speeding up the optimisation process of the SVM hyperparameters via bootstrapping, chiefly focusing on the cases of SVMs with the RBF kernel. In this novel approach, a fast and robust approximation algorithm for constrained nonlinear optimisation, the Box complex algorithm, was used to replace the widely applied yet computationally intensive grid-search.
